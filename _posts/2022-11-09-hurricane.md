Jay and I were playing 0n the SSPS playgr0und. Suddendly, the sky turned dark!
At first we th0ught "Eh, it's an0ther 0ne 0f th0se b00000000ring rainy days.Ughhhh."(FYI, when it rains we have indoor recess)
Then an apple core hit me in the face "Ewwwwwwwww". I thought I said that, when I noticed Jay with a banana peel on his curly,brown hair!
"Geeez" he complained, "The wind is strong today! I hope it doesn't get stronger!" Then it did.
I told him "You jinxed it!", and he just slapped his forehead.
